# Calculator Project

## Introduction
In this project you will be making a very simple calculator web page. This is a primer to review what you've learned about web development, and GitHub.

## Projects and Issues
During this project you will also be learning about the **Projects** and **Issues** tabs on GitHub. You will be expected to use them in this and your next project on GitHub.

## Outcome
The finished product will be a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and clear the screen. It meets the requirements for a **Potentially Shippable Product**, but it will also have features that are **not yet implemented**. You will need to add some of your own features (ie. version 1.1).

## Timeline
This project will take about 2 weeks. Mr. Scheuerlein will walk you through creating **Version 1.0** in the first week and then you will have the second week to finish whichever missing features you want.

## Missing Features
You are free to add whichever features you want, but below are some suggestions if you're not sure what to do:

1. The memory functions have not yet been implemented. Implement them.
2. The try/catch will display an error message for invalid input, but could you prevent invalid input in the first place?
  - Repeated decimals (ie. "1.2.3+4" = "Error")
  - Pressing the equals key when the screen is blank ("undefined")
  - What other errors are there? Can you prevent them?
3. Most calculators display a "0" when you clear them. Make this calculator display "0" upon clearing.
4. It's a little odd that it can display "123+456". How do most calculators do this? Can you fix this one?
5. Add some keys. (Hint: JavaScript has built-in solutions for some of these. Look them up to learn how to use them.)
  - Constants: e, Ï€, etc.
  - Square root
  - Exponents
6. Clicking takes too much work. Make it so pressing your keyboard keys behaves like clicking on the calculator's keys. Warning: this is probably the hardest feature to implement! Expect to do some research!
7. Make this calculator fit for smaller screens.

## Grading
This project is worth 30 points.
- Completion of Mr. Scheuerlein's Version 1.0 Calculator (10 points)
- Functionality (10 points): Does it work? Did you add features? Did you customize how it looked?
- Documentation (10 points): Is the code organized and easy to understand? Do you explain what things are *supposed* to do?

## Branches
- **Master**: This is the branch that your customers will run. They expect it to be complete, mostly bug free, and to update *occasionally*. Don't constantly push changes here! (Imagine getting notified to update your iPad apps every. single. day!)
- **Version 1.0**: This is the branch that you're working towards. Make changes directly to *other* branches and pull request (PR) them to this one.
- **Other branches**: You may have as many other branches as you wish. If you are working on two separate projects simultaneously (ie. **branch1** and **branch2**) and merge one that you completed (**branch1**) into **Version1.0**, you'll need to merge **Version1.0** back onto the other branch (**branch2**) to get those changes, otherwise you risk overwiting those changes! Practice doing this at least once, as you will need to do it in your group project.
