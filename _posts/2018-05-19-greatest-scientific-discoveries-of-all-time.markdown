**1. Red Firetruck Theorum**
Firetrucks are red because they have eight wheels and four people on them, and four plus eight is twelve, 
and there are twelve inches in a foot, and one foot is a ruler, and Queen Elizabeth was a ruler, and Queen Elizabeth was also a ship, 
and the ship sailed the seas and in the seas are fish, and fish have fins, and the Finns fought the Russians, and the Russians are red, 
and fire trucks are always "russian" around.

**2. The Violet and the Rose Theory**
I roses are red and violets are blue then by the commutative property a=b = b+a, then blue is actually violet red and blue make violet
and you need red to make violet and if violet is blue? Then its red and blue but what makes red the past tense of read because the word 
you read more than any other word in this equation...is blue. You READ BLUE, creating violet and because violets are blue,
not only did i blow your mind but anything you just read(past tense) just BLUE your mind.
